# streamdeck-hwinfo-plugin

Alternative to the [hwinfo-streamdeck](https://github.com/shayne/hwinfo-streamdeck) plugin, without needing to use the time limited 'Shared Memory Support' feature. This plugin takes advantage of the new 'HWiNFO Gadgets' feature and is small in size (just 283KB ðŸŒŸ). It is built using the new [Elgato Beta SDK](https://github.com/elgatosf/streamdeck).

- Then the sensors you have enabled will show up in the stream deck plugin

## Maybe for the future?

- Change font colour
- Change font outline colour
- Change graph style e.g. choose outline and fill colour
- Font weight
- Choose where the title and sensor text should appear
- ~~Change Y scale of the graph, so it's not always 0 to 100 as some sensor values may be over 100 such as wattage.~~ Done
- Change speed of polling
- Change graph timescale

## Current known issues

- Enabling HWiNFO gadget on two sensors with the exact same name (very unlikely scenario) may cause issues of the Stream Deck plugin showing the wrong value.
