# streamdeck-hwinfo-plugin

Alternative to the [hwinfo-streamdeck](https://github.com/shayne/hwinfo-streamdeck) plugin, without needing to use the time limited 'Shared Memory Support' feature. This plugin takes advantage of the new 'HWiNFO Gadgets' feature and is small in size (just 1MB ðŸŒŸ)

## Instructions for HWiNFO

- Open HWiNFO and go into the settings - then main settings
- Use these recommended settings

- Then the sensors you have enabled will show up in the stream deck plugin

## Maybe for the future?

- Change font colour
- Change font outline colour
- Change graph style e.g. choose outline and fill colour
- Font weight
- Choose where the title and sensor text should appear
- ~~Change Y scale of the graph, so it's not always 0 to 100 as some sensor values may be over 100 such as wattage.~~ Done
- Change speed of polling, currently checks for sensor values every 2 seconds
- Change graph timescale (e.g. only show last 30 seconds on the screen, currently shows 72 seconds)

## Current known issues

- Enabling HWiNFO gadget on two sensors with the exact same name (very unlikely scenario) may cause issues of the Stream Deck plugin showing the wrong value.
